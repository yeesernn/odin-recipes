        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A very easy and delicious dish that Uncle Roger is obsessed with. (If you don't know him, look him up on YouTube) </p>
        <p>The trick here is to use day old rice, and a extremely hot wok (or cast iron skillet).</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cooked long grain rice, day old is best</li>
                <li>Oil</li>
                <li>Salt and MSG</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Peas</li>
                <li>Carrots</li>
                <li>Chicken/Shrimp/Tofu (optional)</li>
                <li>Soy sauce</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the ingredients: crack the eggs into a bowl, diced up the veggies etc</li>
                <li>Add oil into your wok over high heat, wait until some smoke started coming out</li>
                <li>Crack the eggs and immediately stir them to break them up</li>
                <li>If you have chicken/shrimp/tofu, toss them in and stir for a minute</li>
                <li>Add the veggies and continue stirring for a minute</li>
                <li>Toss the rice in and break them up to prevent any clump. Stir for a few minutes</li>
                <li>Add a pinch of salt and MSG</li>
                <li>Dribble a dash of soy sauce and stir continuously to cover the grains evenly</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There you have it, serve while its piping hot!</p>
