        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The braised pork may have it's origin in China, but as our ancestors immigrate across the ocean, this dish was brought all over the world and adopted it's twist in flavors adapting to the people of the country. 
        In Malaysia, my grandma and mum make this dish a lot, but now I am thousands of miles away from home, I can only make my own if I miss this flavor.
        Here I bring you all the 'original' braised pork recipe originating from Shang Hai, best served over white rice as comfort food.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pork belly 12 ounces or 350 grams</li>
                <li>Oil 2 tablespoons</li>
                <li>Rock sugar (or granulated sugar) 1 tablespoon</li>
                <li>Wine (ShaoXing cooking wine) 3 tablespoons or 45 ml</li>
                <li>Soy sauce 1 tablespoon </li>
                <li>Dark soy sauce 1/2 tablespoon</li>
                <li>2 cups of water</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Just <b>SIX</b> ingredients! (if you don't count the water)</p>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by cutting the pork belly into 3/4 inch (or 2cm) thick pieces.</li>
                <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the pork for a couple of minutes then take them out and set aside. This gets rid of impurities and starts the cooking process.</li>
                <li>Add oil and sugar to your wok over low heat and melt the sugar slightly.</li>
                <li>Add the pork and raise to medium heat and cook until the pork is lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Once browned, turn the heat back down to low and add the wine, regular soy sauce, dark soy sauce and water. It is very important for the color and flavor of this dish that you have both types of soy sauce.</li>
                <li>Cover and simmer over medium heat for about 45 minutes to 1 hour until the pork is fork tender. Every 5-10 minutes, stir to prevent burning and add more water if it gets too dry. </li>
                <li>Once the pork is fork tender, if there is still a lot of leftover liquids, uncover the wok, turn up the heat and stir continuously until the sauce is reduced to a glistening coating.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And <i>VIOLA!</i> It's ready to eat, best served over freshly cooked white rice!</p>
