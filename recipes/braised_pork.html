        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The braised pork may have it's origin in China, but as our ancestors immigrate across the ocean, this dish was brought all over the world and adopted it's twist in flavors adapting to the people of the country. 
        In Malaysia, my grandma and mum make this dish a lot, but now I am thousands of miles away from home, I can only make my own if I miss this flavor.
        Here I bring you all the 'original' braised pork recipe originating from Shang Hai, best served over white rice as comfort food.
