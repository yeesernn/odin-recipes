# odin-recipes

First Odin's project - use HTML to create a simple recipe webpage which consists of an index page which will link to other pages containing recipes

Today in Web Dev university class we are already doing CSS FlexBox when today is only our third class, only for a total of 8 hours... 
I had a lot of difficulty trying to structure the webpage and make it work like how I wanted it to.

After this project I hope to be able to have more HTML fundamentals drilled into my mind.

Links to the source of the recipes:
